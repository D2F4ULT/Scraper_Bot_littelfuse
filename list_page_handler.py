# list_page_handler.py
# --------------------
# This module contains a helper function to click the first product
# in the search results list when the current page shows multiple items.
# It uses Selenium's WebDriverWait to ensure the element is clickable
# before attempting to interact with it.

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  # For locating elements (e.g., By.ID, By.CLASS_NAME)
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait  # For waiting until elements meet conditions
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC  # Predefined wait conditions
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException  # Raised when a wait exceeds its time limit

        driver: Selenium WebDriver instance controlling the browser.
        wait: Selenium WebDriverWait instance for waiting until elements are ready.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the first result was clicked successfully, False if it timed out.
